      ## Set the capacity to auto-scale
      ### PAY_PER_REQUEST (On-Demand Capacity): for starting out, and workloads are not very predictable or stable
      ### Provisioned Capacity: cheaper when knowing exactly how much capacity is needed
      BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
    ## To prevent accidentally deleting serverless resources (DynamoDB in this case)
    ### e.g with a typo in the resource name (NotesTable), the old table will be removed and a new one will be created in place
